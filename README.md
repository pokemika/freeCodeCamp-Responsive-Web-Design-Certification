# freeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Certification

A repo to document my learning with the freeCodeCamp course and keep my certification projects.

This certification teaches responsive web design through a series of projects. The program covers HTML, CSS, design principles, typography and color theory.
In order to earn it, you must complete 5 certification projects that demonstrate your understanding of the concepts taught.
These projects include building responsive websites, creating visual designs, and debugging code.

This is my progress through the course (as I'm studying with other resources too), serving as documentation of what I saw on each lesson.
